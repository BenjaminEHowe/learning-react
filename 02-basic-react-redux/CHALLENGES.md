# Additional challenges

1. Add support for administering authors. Handle deleting authors who have courses (cascade? block? something else?)
2. Add filters for the course list at the top of the course list table
3. Hide the course list table when there are no courses
4. Warn the user if they try to leave the manage course form when they have unsaved changes
5. Enhance the client and server side validation on the manage course form
6. Handle invalid course slugs on the manage course page (hint: use mapStateToProps)
7. Show the number of courses in the header
8. Add pagination to the course table
9. Sort course table - or add drop-downs above the table to allow the table to be sorted by different columns (again, try using mapStateToProps)
10. Keep old course data so users can view history and "undo" changes
